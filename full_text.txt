Who are the Albanians?

Let's start with some general information​​​​​​in


This is a Balkan people, as of today​​​​​​​​numbering


but at the same time, less than half


The Albanian diaspora is scattered
all over the world

In many countries, it has

Stars such as Dua Lipa and Rita Ora
are of Albanian origin.

​​​​​​Also Ava Max and Bebe Reja.​​







The self-name of the Albanians is Shkiptaret, and


In translation, Skiperia
means the land of eagles

Whether it is people who speak an
intelligible language

The Albanian language is actually
very specific

Although it belongs to the Indo-European languages, it
is considered one of the Paleo-Balkan languages.




This is not surprising, because most scientists consider


who lived in the Balkans long before
the arrival of the Slavs.

However, Albanians have managed to preserve
their identity and language to this day.

Slavic-Greek environment.

Well, and then the Ottoman-Venetian


​ ​however, they still survived.​ ​

Well, what about the name​​​​​​​Albania,


That is, the country is known all


There are, well, many​​​​​​​​variants


From the tribe of Albanians, from


​ ​from the Illyrian word Olba. ​

Translated as "settlement".

​ ​From the Latin "albus" - "white".​ ​

From the Greek "albanos" translated


​ ​And these are only the most common versions. ​

During the reign of the Ottoman Empire, many
Albanians converted to Islam.

It is the influence of the Ottomans
that explains the fact that Albania

and Bosnia and Herzegovina
are two states

which are located entirely in Europe​​​​​​and

The darker the green, the higher the percentage
of Muslims in this country.

during the First Balkan War

although to a large extent precisely thanks to​​​​​​the


if it weren't for them, Italy would hardly have been


However, as the winner, Italy was dissatisfied
with the modest territorial gains

against the background of very heavy
human and material losses

That's why, after the war, the Italians tried in different


For example, in June-September 1920, they tried
to capture the city and port of Vlora,

It is in the south of Albania,
with an adjacent district

on the grounds that when​ ​Entente


Italy was joining the Entente,


and signed the secret
London Treaty

The Entente promised Italy the accession
of the Vlora district

Of course, at the same time, the Entente did not
care whether the Albanians wanted it.

However, now, when in 1920 the
Italians tried to take it away,

The Albanians put up a very fierce resistance
and defeated the Italians.

The Italians fought so sluggishly,​​​​​​with


​ and also suffered from a malaria epidemic

as a result, they were forced
to leave Vlora

​​​​Vlora remained behind Albania.​​​​

and the Italians only managed


Its area is 5.7 km²

and it is located near Vlora​ ​​​​​at


​ ​Here is its location on the map.​ ​

What is in the left corner was an
enlarged image of the island.

The Italians controlled this island of Sazani for
quite a long time, 27 years in total.

and officially returned it to the Albanians only
after the Second World War in 1947,

after Italy lost the
Second World War

By the way, today it is the largest
island of Albania by area

and officially, there is no​​​​​​permanent


However, in Italy they did not forget about that humiliating
defeat in the war for Vlora in 1920.

Especially when the fascists led by


Revenge for Vlora was​​​​​​one


Interwar Albania was a very poor, backward,
agrarian country.

It lacked stability and constantly suffered from
political and social upheavals.

​ ​Original Albania was a principality,​ ​

and the throne was occupied by the German​​ ​​​​prince


Well, not quite Wied,​ ​ ​Viet


but let it be so, ours​ ​​​is


However, in 1914 he became a prince

but already in September 1914, when the First World


​ ​He never came back again.​ ​

And in the meantime, Albania formally remained


​ ​The monarch who escaped.​ ​

In 1924, Orthodox bishop


From the name, it may seem that he is​​​​​​some


​​​​ Orthodox bishop from Albania, yes.​​

Well, you can imagine. What is an Orthodox
bishop at the head of a Muslim country

And besides, this bishop sympathizes
with communists.

​ ​And specifically to the Soviet Union.​ ​




And already in December 1924, he was overthrown by the
troops of former Prime Minister Ahmet Zogu.

These troops came from the territory of the neighboring
Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​The future of Yugoslavia.​​​​




And now white emigrants,​ ​ ​political


And they were commanded by Major General
Ilya Miklashevskyi

By the way, this is a descendant of the Ukrainian


​​​​​​whose roots are from Chernihiv region.​​​​

And Miklashevsky himself was born either in
Odessa or in the Katerynoslav province.

That's right, friends, the descendants of the Cossack elite, who


became Russian officers, fought for the Russian
emperors Dinikin and Wrangel.

It was in Dinikin's army that Miklashevskyi received
the rank of major general.




And now in 1924, these


​​​​​​in intra-Albanian clashes.​​​​

​ ​Why?​ ​

First of all, because the king
of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes

have become one of the largest
shelters for white emigration.

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

And secondly, because in this action against
the pro-communist bishop Fannoli

They saw the continuation of their
struggle against the red menace

​​​​ With Bolshevism.​​​​

And they were, as they say,
glad to take part in it

Basically, for the same reasons
as later, in 1936-39,

white emigrants will participate​​​​​​in


​ ​On the side of Franko, of course.​ ​

And of course, they considered Bishop
Fannoli an agent of Moscow.

​ ​Not without reason.​ ​

Because then Fannoli openly​​ ​​​​collaborated


​ ​Communist International.​ ​

​​​​In 1927, he came to Moscow.​​​​

And there he spoke at the "Congress
of Friends of the Soviet Union".

There are different bishops, right?

So, at the turn of 1924-1925 years​ ​ ​ ​returned


​​​​ former Prime Minister Ahmet Zogu.​​

And already at the beginning of 1925

The constituent assembly elected him the first
president of the country in history

And with very broad powers,​​​​​​​actually


This is Ahmed Zogu with us​​​​​​​​he


And he is one of the main characters
of our story today.

​ ​Very specific character.​ ​

​ ​Descendant from the Albanian elite. ​

Born, of course, back in the
days of the Ottoman Empire

​ ​Grandson of Bayraktar.​ ​

No, this is not a Turkish drone

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

This is the head of the civil-military administration
on the lands of Albania,

​ ​as part of the Ottoman Empire.​ ​

According to his mother's line, Ahmed
Zogu considered himself a descendant

Skanderbeg's sisters

Skanderbeg is a cult figure
in the history of Albania

The leader of the anti-Ottoman uprising
of the 15th century

Maybe, of course, Zogu is something​ ​​​​​over


who considered herself a descendant
of Skanderbeg's sister

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

​ ​in order to add authority.​​​​

Because Skanderbeg is the national​​​​​​​​hero


​ ​Here is his portrait.​ ​

Monuments to him are being
erected all over Albania

He is depicted on Albanian banknotes. Movies


And one of the most famous Albanian
football clubs is named after him.

​ ​Skanderbeu from the city of Korcha. ​

In addition to the fact that Korča
is the capital of Albanian beer,

There is also such a football
club, Skanderbeu

So what plans did the Italians


As of the summer of 1938, the Italian​ ​​​community


These were both immigrants


who worked either under a
contract or seasonally

In fact, the Italians already controlled all the
most important sectors of the Albanian economy.

More than 92% of Albanian
exports went to Italy.

And over 82% of Albanian imports
came from Italy

So, Albania was already completely


There was no special need
for military occupation

However, Mussolini was too tired​​​​​​to


conduct a lightning operation, which was supposed to


and authority in Hitler's eyes

In Rome, Albania was seen as
a very fertile land

with the possibility of placing several​ ​ ​millions


​ ​But these were erroneous calculations.​ ​

If you look at the map, and this is​ ​ ​just


We see that more than 70% of the country's territory
is occupied by forests and mountains,

​ ​mountains up to 2700 meters high,​ ​

and agriculture is mainly practiced


​ ​which is less than 30% of the country's area.​ ​

​ ​However, however.​ ​

After all, Albania should also
become a land bridgehead

for further aggression to the south,​​​​​​​aggression


And here Mussolini played a political game
with Yugoslavia as well.

He offered Yugoslavia to join the aggression
against Albania and Greece

in exchange for the fact that later,


Mussolini will give Yugoslavia a corridor
to the Aegean Sea

​​​​​​through the port city of Thessaloniki.​​​​

This is what he enticed Yugoslav
politicians with

The Yugoslav Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign
Affairs was a supporter of this idea.

​ ​Serb by origin Milon Stoyadynovych.​​​​

However, in fact, the Duce was simultaneously building plans


​​​​that is, he played such a very double game.​​

However, when Stoyadinovich
resigned in early 1939,

The official Belgrade no longer showed any interest
in participating in the division of Albania.

November 30, 1938 at a speech​​​​​​before


Mussolini promised revenge for the defeat of
the Italians in Vlora in 1920.

​ ​He declared, Albania will be Italian. ​

On February 7, 1939, the Italian
General Staff decided

invade Albania on
the eve of Easter

Galeazzo Chano wrote in February
in his diary:

They found out that Queen Geraldine

And they hoped that this was such an additional psychological
factor of pressure on him.

If you time the invasion somewhere​ ​​​before


​ ​or immediately after childbirth.​ ​

Rome hoped that this would encourage Zog to
capitulate without resistance.

And this is what Galeazzo Cano wrote


"There is one fact that

However, Mussolini, in
fact, he still hesitated

And finally all his doubts were dispelled by Hitler's

Mussolini made sure that if everything

Because they mainly consisted

Georgiy Lyashenko asks​​​​​​a


"Why was the army of Italy so weak compared
to the army of the Third Reich?"

​​​​In my opinion, there can be many reasons.​​

The Italian economy is significantly
weaker than the German economy

There are, in my opinion, purely
subjective factors

more lyrical, looser,
softer or something.




Less disciplined,​​​​​​​obviously,


Because the Germans have always had discipline almost ​​​​​not


​​​​​​And this was given enormous attention.​​

​ ​And the Italians, an interesting point, right? ​

Despite the fact that the fascist
ideology, the fascist regime

also tried to instill such discipline
in the population.

They took part in the overthrow
of this regime in 1943

not even have time to think about

regime, today it is gone.

​​​​Krovyanka, this is such a nickname.​​

"Did Mussolini actually plan to restore
the Roman Empire?"

Well, of course, in the state


Of course, he did not plan to
restore in those borders

Because it was unreal

because, for example, the Roman Empire

Germany at that time
